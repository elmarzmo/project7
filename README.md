Project Summary:
This program is an Inventory Analyzer designed to solve the problem of analyzing the frequency of items in an inventory.
 The program offers features like looking up the frequency of a specific word, printing item frequencies, and displaying a histogram of item frequencies.

What was done particularly well:

The program is well-structured with the use of a class, making it organized and encapsulating related functionality.
It provides a menu-driven user interface.
Data is loaded from an input file, analyzed, and optionally saved to an output file, offering data persistence.

Where could you enhance your code:

Error Handling: The code lacks comprehensive error handling for file operations. Adding error checks for file existence and opening/closing files would make it more robust.
Input Validation: The program does not handle invalid user inputs gracefully. Improved input validation can prevent unexpected behavior.
Testing: Thorough testing with various input scenarios is essential to ensure the program's correctness.

Challenging Parts:
One of the challenging aspects of writing this code could be handling errors and exceptions, especially when working with files. 
Handling user input validation and unexpected situations can also be complex.

Transferable Skills:
Skills gained from this project that are transferable to other projects or coursework include:
Working with file input/output in C++.
User interface design and interaction through a menu system.
Basic error handling and validation techniques.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:
The program is maintainable and adaptable due to its modular design with a class, making it easy to extend or modify the functionality.
 the code provides a good foundation for an inventory analysis tool and can be improved and extended as needed.
